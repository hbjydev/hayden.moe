        I love working with all things DevOps, from automation and software
        engineering to full-on platform engineering. I’m a huge advocate for making
        things self-service and as reproducible as possible (hence my love/hate
        relationship with <a href="https://nixos.org">Nix</a>).
      </p>

      <p>
        Recently, I’ve been learning how to build developer-focal automation,
        building up understanding of how to view both sides of the infrastructure
        coin; platform administration and developers.

        I think pineapple on pizza is a crime, I listen to everything from rock and
        indie to jungle and breakcore, and I’m a huge fan of virtual reality.
      </p>

      <p>
        I’m based in Sheffield, in the UK, and I’m always open to having
        conversations with people about any topic you think I’d find interesting.
